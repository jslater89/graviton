# Graviton
Graviton is a golang web application for receiving, saving, and displaying time-series gravity readings from wireless hydrometers.

[Gravity](https://github.com/jslater89/gravity) is a Vue.js web front end for Graviton. [Pendulum](https://github.com/jslater89/pendulum) is an Arduino/ESP-8266-based tilt hydrometer, small enough to fit through the neck of a glass carboy, designed to work with Graviton.

Graviton will also eventually support the [iSpindel](https://github.com/universam1/iSpindel) tilt hydrometer.
